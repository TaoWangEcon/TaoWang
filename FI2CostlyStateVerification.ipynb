    "- Under asymmetric information, lender requires a higher-than-safe-return premium. The preminum increases with agency cost, safe rate and decreases with expected return of the project and net-wealth of the entrepreneur. These highlight the financial imperfection that lead to credit rationning and under-financing of the investment project.   \n",
