	 <li><i>Rigidity of Expectations, Additional Evidence from Density Forecast of the Inflation of Professionals and Households</i></li>
         Density forecasts of macroeconomic variables provide one additional moment restriction, uncertainty, for testing and exploring the implications of theories about how people form expectations differently from full-information rationality benchmark. This paper first documents the persistent dispersion in inflation uncertainty of professionals and households, and how it conveys different in- formation from the widely used proxies to uncertainty such as cross-sectional disagreement and forecast errors. Second, utilizing the panel data structure of both surveys, I provide additional reduced-form test results as well as structural estimates for each particular theory of “irrational expectation” by jointly ac- counting for its predictions for different moments. This is a natural extension of Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012), which examines different moments sepa- rately. Also, motivated by the time-varying pattern of the uncertainty observed from surveys, I extend their work to allow for an alternative inflation process featuring stochastic volatility. These extensions allow me to match the joint dynamics of inflation and forecast moments in better goodness of fit. It also testifies how incorporating higher moments from survey data helps understand both the expectation formation mechanisms and inflation dynamics.
